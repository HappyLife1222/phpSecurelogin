phpSecureLogin
==============

NOTE: THIS IS NOT YET A WORKING PROJECT!

A secure login module for PHP.  The idea is that it should be easily plugged into any PHP project.

The base code for this project has been taken from WikiHow:

http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Secure-Login-Script-in-PHP-and-MySQL

The idea is to modify the code so that it forms a module that can easily be plugged into other PHP projects requiring login functionality.

When it's done, users will be able to select from a variety of configuration options such as:

* Connect via http or https
* Specify database connection details
* Elect whether all users should be allowed to regist or whether only certain types of users should be able to do registrations (i.e. register other users)

I'm happy to receive any suggestions (peredur@peredur.net).  And if anyone would like to help...
